i am migrating from using js to ts in my ui
ui is react project not next project
i am migrating from mui and matirial to shadcn and lucide with modern design 
the old pages are in /packages/ui/src/views
the new pages are in /packages/ui/src/pages
the old components are in /packages/ui/ui-component
the new components are in /packages/ui/components
the shadcn components are in /packages/ui/components/ui
the old layouts are in /packages/ui/layout
the new layouts are in /packages/ui/components/layout
/packages/ui is my old frontend at port 8080
/packages/server is my backend at port 3000
I already have the pnpm dev running Executing the command npm run dev will interrupt the server process causing the app to crash.
do not hallucinate new configs or new api endpoints already in project in @/api @/hooks @/utils @/routes @/lib @/store
do not claim perfect or success without testing 
always check missing imports and linter errors 
use pnpm not npm
